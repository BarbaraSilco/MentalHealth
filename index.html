            <p>
                Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
                It affects how we think, feel, act, make choices, and relate to others. 
                Mental health is more than the absence of a mental illness—it s essential to your overall health and quality of life. 
                Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.
